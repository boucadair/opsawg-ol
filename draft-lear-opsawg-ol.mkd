--- abstract

This memo provides for an extension to RFC 8520 that allows
MUD file authors to specify ownership and licensing of MUD
files themselves.  This memo updates RFC 8520.  However, it
can also be used for purposes outside of MUD, and the grouping
is structured as such.

Introduction
============

{{RFC8520}} Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) can be used to
describe devices and their requirements to the network infrastructure.
The original version of the specification does not provide for a
means to specify ownership and licensing of the MUD file itself.  This
can hinder those wishing to use, modify, or adapt MUD files for the
purpose of offering them, when the manufacturer is not involved.


To avoid any confusion, we define an extension that allows for
specifying of owners and licensing terms for MUD files.

Those generating MUD files SHOULD use this extension, and
thus this extension updates RFC 8520.

There are two ways to specify a license: a URL pointing to the license
itself or an SPDX tag {{SPDX}}.  If an SPDX tag is supplied consumers
MUST interpret that tag through its meaning as specified by {{SPDX}}.

This grouping may be used for other YANG models that reside as
static objects.

The owner-license extension and model
======================================

Because the model is primarily motivated by MUD, and based
on the way that YANG trees are formed, the model appears as
an augmentation for MUD.

~~~~~~~~~
module: ietf-ol

  augment /mud:mud:
    +--rw ol
       +--rw owners*               string
       +--rw (license-type)?
          +--:(spdx-lt)
          |  +--rw spdx-tag?       string
          +--:(url)
             +--rw license-info?   inet:uri

~~~~~~~~~

The YANG schema for ownership and licensing
============================

The following grouping and augmentation are proposed.

~~~~~
<CODE BEGINS>file "ietf-ol@2021-05-21.yang"
{::include ietf-ol@2021-05-21.yang}
<CODE ENDS>
~~~~~

Extension for MUD
=================

MUD files using this extension MUST include "ol" in the extensions
array, as specified by {{RFC8520}}.

Example
=======


~~~~~~~~
{
  "ietf-mud:mud": {
    "mud-version": 1,
    "mud-url": "https://iot-device.example.com/dnsname",
    "last-update": "2019-01-15T10:22:47+00:00",
    "cache-validity": 48,
    "is-supported": true,
    "systeminfo": "device that wants to talk to a cloud service",
    "mfg-name": "Example, Inc.",
    "documentation": "https://frobinator.example.com/doc/frob2000",
    "model-name": "Frobinator 2000",
    "extensions" : [
       "ol"
      ],
    "ol" : {
         "owners" : [ "Eliot Lear" ],
         "license-info" : "MIT-0",
      }
  }
}

Security Considerations
=======================

No security considerations have been identified.

IANA Considerations
===================

MUD Extension
-------------

The IANA is requested to add "ol" to the MUD
extensions registry as follows:

~~~~~~~

  Extension Name: ol
  Standard reference: This document
